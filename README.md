## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `pnpm dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `pnpm build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `pnpm preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `pnpm astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `pnpm astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
| `pnpm optimize:images` | Resize, compress and rename gallery photos       |

## ☁️ Manual deployment (Cloudflare Workers)

The site runs as a Cloudflare **Worker** with static assets (`output: 'server'`, `@astrojs/cloudflare`).

1. `pnpm install`
2. `pnpm run build` → worker bundle in `dist/_worker.js`, static assets in `./dist`
3. `npx wrangler login` (once), then `npx wrangler deploy` — or `pnpm run deploy`

`wrangler.toml` already points `main` at `dist/_worker.js/index.js` and serves assets from `./dist`.
Files that must never be uploaded (dependencies, build output, local secrets) are listed in `.gitignore`.

## 🖼️ Image guidelines

Gallery photos live in `public/gallery/` and follow the naming pattern
`chocolate-hills-carmen-bohol-<n>.jpg`. Run `pnpm optimize:images` after adding new
photos — it caps the longest edge at 1600 px, re-encodes as progressive JPEG (quality 76)
and removes metadata, which keeps page weight low.
